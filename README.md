## Running Tests

To ensure the algorithms work correctly, test cases are provided. Run the test cases by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python test_algorithms.py

### **Summary**

1. **Write Test Cases:** Include test cases in your main script or a separate testing script.
2. **Cover Scenarios:** Ensure test cases cover various scenarios and edge cases.
3. **Run Tests:** Execute the tests to verify the correctness of your algorithms.
4. **Document Tests:** Describe how to run tests in your README file.

This approach helps you verify that your implementations are correct and efficient.
